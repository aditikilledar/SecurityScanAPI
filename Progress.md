Random Questions / Doubts:
1. Can I assume that all the json files that will be scanned will be of a similar format? 
    I think YES for this example.

2. "Concurrency: Process â‰¥ 3 files in parallel."
    Does the problem statement mean concurrency or parallelism??
    I have assumed Concurrency, and used goroutines.

3. "Error Handling: Retry failed GitHub API calls (2 attempts)."
    Total number of attempts should be 3 or 2?
    I have implemented as 1 attempt and 2 reattempt.
